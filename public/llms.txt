# Human Vector

> Business scaling solution for companies with 40+ employees

Human Vector helps growth-stage companies overcome the organizational bottlenecks that appear at 40+ employees. Based on Oleg Kondrashov's methodology from scaling EnCata over 15 years.

## What We Solve

- Companies stuck at 40-100 employees unable to grow profitably
- Founder bottlenecks and delegation failures
- Misaligned teams working against each other ("vectors pointing in different directions")
- Scaling costs outpacing revenue growth
- Lack of visibility into where payroll dollars go
- Middle performers who could become top performers with proper tracking
- Remote/hybrid team accountability challenges

## Our Solution

A proven system that aligns team efforts ("vectors") toward profitable growth, not just headcount growth.

Key capabilities:
- Employee Vector tracking (Skills, Loyalty, Gravity, Integration, Speed)
- Real-time time tracking with overtime visibility
- Transparent salary calculations employees can verify
- Department self-service reporting
- Task tracker integration (Jira and others)
