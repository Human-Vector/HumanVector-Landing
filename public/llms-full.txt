## The Problem We Solve

Companies at 40+ employees face a critical scaling bottleneck:

1. **Founder Bottleneck**: The founder becomes the decision-making bottleneck, unable to delegate effectively
2. **Misaligned Teams**: Different departments work toward different goals, wasting resources
3. **Invisible Underperformance**: Middle performers hide in the noise, draining profitability
4. **Payroll Opacity**: No visibility into where salary dollars actually go
5. **Culture Dilution**: The culture that made the company successful dilutes as headcount grows
6. **Remote Accountability**: Hybrid/remote teams lack accountability without surveillance

**The result:** Scaling costs outpace revenue growth, and companies get stuck between 40-100 employees.

## Our Solution: The Vector Methodology

Human Vector provides complete visibility into time, performance, and compensation through:

### 1. Employee Vector Tracking
Each employee is measured on 5 dimensions:
- **Skills**: Technical competence and knowledge
- **Loyalty**: Commitment and alignment with company goals
- **Gravity**: Influence and leadership capability
- **Integration**: How well they work with the team
- **Speed**: Execution velocity and responsiveness

### 2. Performance Visibility
- Daily standards testing ensures knowledge retention
- Structured training levels with clear progression paths
- Real-time tracking (not annual reviews)

### 3. Time & Compensation Transparency
- Real-time time tracking with overtime visibility
- Transparent salary calculations employees can verify themselves
- Complete visibility into where every payroll dollar goes

### 4. Management Efficiency
- Department heads get self-service reporting
- Saves founders 10-15 hours/week of management time
- Decisions backed by data, not gut feel

### 5. Culture Preservation
- Transparent suggestion tracking with status updates
- Employees see their ideas matter
- Results in ~32% less turnover

### 6. Remote/Hybrid Support
- Task tracker integration (Jira, etc.)
- Works regardless of employee location
- Accountability without surveillance
